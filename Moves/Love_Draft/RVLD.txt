Title: Revisiting Love's Draft

Image: JL_Draft.jpeg

Text: So I was recently thinking about the move up to get Jordan Love. I don't even know where to start, so I'll start with 
that draft. Imagine you're a Packers fan, and it's late April, 2020. You just saw Rodgers and LaFluer take your team to the 
NFC championship and get blown out by the 9ers. You gotta be thinking that they are one player away, and they really need a 
weapon, especailly with how abysmal that receiving core was. Your top recievers were Davante Adams (997 yards), Allen Lazard 
(477 yards), and Aaron Jones (474 yards). Rodgers barely scratched 4000 yards (11th most), threw 26 touchdowns (10th most), 
and 4 INTs. This is clearly a team who was a receiving weapon away from getting over the hump to the superbowl.

Text: I looked back on the mock drafts at the time, and saw that many analysts had the Packers taking Aiyuk, Denzel Mims, 
or Johnathan Taylor at 30. No wonder there was real suprise when Gutekunst and Co. traded up to take Love at 26. When I look 
back at it now, my question is not whether or not another reieving weapon (Like Higgins or Mims) would have brought the Packers to
a superbowl, but did LaFluer and Gutekunst believe Rodgers had hit his ceiling.

Text: In football, any player can only do so much in his position. Even if that player is doing the best he can, there's always
someone who can do better in their position, and I wonder if that's how LaFluer saw Rodgers and Love. Even if you despise Rodgers,
you have to admit he has had a lot of success during his tenure. However, it's interesting to think that LaFluer thought he could get 
someone better than Rodgers. 

Text: Beyond the stats, you also gotta take age and context into this factor. Rodgers was 36 at this time and was coming off his 
15th season in the league, with over 150 starts at that point. He did have some injuries throughout his time, but nothing that was 
concerning. He was playing the game at a high but not elite level, and many were speculating that he might be close to retirement. 
His game was starting to taper off a bit, but not at a concerning level. 26 touchdowns to 4 interceptions is definitely in the top 
10, but wasn't comparable to his stats in his hayday. With age catching up, was Rodgers on a downward trajectory?

Text: For LaFluer, he had come off his first season as a head coach, and the stakes for him were high. Having brought this Packers 
team to an NFC championship, the expectations were superbowl or bust. But LaFluer also had run ins Rodgers, especially over how 
the offense was conducted and the playcalling. Rodgers had preferred an older offensive scheme similar to McCarthy's. LaFluer's 
offense was Shanahan and McVay driven, focused on timing and play action. This was definitely a point of contention, but nothing 
that had created a toxic environment. 

Text: In addition to small skirmishes, LaFluer wanted to make sure he was a step ahead. He didn't want to be in a situation where 
if Rodgers had up and retired, that the Packers had no starting QB in the line up. With the Packers picking at 30 in the 2020 draft
it was possible for them to pick up a developmental QB who could take a couple years to sit behind a starter and grow. Many qb's, 
including Rodgers, Mahomes, and Philip Rivers had gone down this route.

Text: Looking at the 2020 draft, there were 3 QBs who were bound to go in the top 10: Joe Burrow, Justin Herbert, and Tua Tagovailoa.
After that, there was a significant drop off to the next wave of Jordan Love and Jalen Hurts. Jordan Love had 3 seasons (38 games) 
at Utah state. In his final season, he threw for for 20 touchdowns and 17 interceptions, going for 3402 yards. While he did have a 
strong arm for explosive deep passes, he also had issues with his read progressions and field vision. His mechanics were inconsistent,
and the high touchdown to interception ratio in his final year would have turned off NFL GMs. Nevertheless, he was projected to go 
between the last first and early second round. Many teams saw him as a developmental kind of QB, one who could grow into the starting 
position. 

Text: LaFluer's offense was optimized for athleticism, arm strength and pocket poise, qualitites that Jordan Love had embodied during
his time at Utah State. Love was strong with pre snap motion, play‑action, and creating favorable reads. This is what LaFluer's offenses
focused on. Along with the positives, LaFluer knew he had at least another year, if not multiple, to sit and develop Love behind Rodgers. 
LaFluer knew that if he could take the inconsistencies and hiccups out of Love's game, becoming a starting QB wouldn't be too difficult for Love.

Text: While drafting Love may not have given Rodgers another receiving weapon to compliment Davante Adams, it did add pressure. Similar to
when the Patriots had drafted Garoppolo in 2014 to add pressure to Brady, the Packers were using Love to heat up Rodgers seat. In turn,
Rodgers responded with back to back MVP seasons in 2020 and 2021, each with over 4000 passing yard, 35 touchdowns and under 6 interceptions.
Even in 2022, when the team went on a losing  record, Rodgers put up solid stats.

Text: Even with these strong years of production, the Packers were willing to move off of Rodgers and enter the Jordan Love era. Rodgers had 
the front office had a lot of friction during this time. In 2021, Adam Schefter reported that Rodgers is “disgruntled” and doesn’t want to return.
He had felt as if they were planning his exit, and desired more respect and a stronger voice in personnel decisions. Utlimately, this drama, coupled
with his declined play in 2022 was enough for both sides to break up, leading the Packers to trade him to the Jets in April 2023.

Text: Looking back on it now, it's hard not to say the Packers made the right decision to draft Love. Jordan Love over the last two seasons 
(2023 and 2024) has thrown for at least 3300 yards each of those seasons, with 4159 yards in 2023. He also led the Packers to 2 postseasons, 
including a crushing victory against the 2nd seeded Cowboys in 2023 in the wild card round. While he has had good and bad streaks during his time,
the front office has enough faith in him, as they gave him a 4 year, $220 million contract with $160 million guaranteed. 

Text: However, the question remains on whether or not the Packers would have gotten a superbowl if they had gotten a receiving weapon with the 30th pick in 
the draft. I'm not going to go into a whole "what if" scenario, but I will lay some facts out. Many GMs view the bottom of the first round and top of the 
second round as a place for drafting guys who can become solid starters. Day 2 rookie recievers like Terry McLaurin, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and even Tee Higgins were 
viewed as starers who could contribute solid production when drafted, but weren't expected to revolutionize an offense and bring home a superbowl. 
At that time in Feburary, it would have been unrealistic to think that a rookie Tee Higgins, Michael Pittman JR, or Denzel Mims would have been the missing 
piece for the Packers to get to the superbowl.

Text: Looking back, the Packers’ decision to draft Jordan Love was bold, controversial, and ultimately forward-thinking. While it didn’t give Rodgers the immediate 
receiving help fans wanted, it positioned the team for a smoother transition to its next franchise quarterback. Love has shown enough promise to justify the pick, 
proving that sometimes building for the future means making uncomfortable decisions in the present. Whether a receiver in 2020 would have made the difference for 
a Super Bowl run remains uncertain, but what is clear is that the Packers stuck to their draft-and-develop philosophy — and so far, it’s paying off.
