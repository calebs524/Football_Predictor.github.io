Hi. I am a football enthusiast. I am a bears fan, a Chicago native. I've been watching since I was 10 and
for the last couple of years, have really paid attention to the different types of moves teams have made, in
terms of trades, accquisitions, contracts, and hires. I enjoy learning about different schemes and moves set 
by teams, and I will continue to be interested in football. 
The goal of this page is to provide my thoughts on what is going on in the football world. I will try to upload
my predicions and analysis of the games, and maybe even some of my thoughts about what has happened. Please don't
take any of this too seriously, I am only a 22 year old guy who likes to watch football and nothing more. I have 
no career or professional background in the sport, I only know what I hear about in the game. Thank you.
