    "Comments": "If God ever gave the Eagles a gift, it would be this game. The Eagles D, outside of the Saints game, has played
    poorly, and needs a reset. If Siriani and his roster could get back on the same page, this wouldn't be a game, this would be a 
    team bonding exercise. Saying the Browns suck is generous, and Stefanski has probabaly lost all hope to get his team back on track.
    It would take a miracle (and maybe a massage) to get Watson to even semi-competent QB play. The eagles have a chance to change their 
    narrative here, and if they can't take it, then they are in for a long ride."
