    "Comments": "Both of these teams are coming off pretty heartbreaking losses. Both of these teams are pretty banged up, 
but the 9ers are just playing bad football right now. Lets see if Purdy can rebound his mistakes against this Mike Mcdonald lead
defense, which only has 2 INTs this season, gave up 6 TDs, and a 93.2 rating to opposing QBs. Last time Shanahan faced up against
Mcdonald was the 2023 Christmas game, where the Ravens beat up the 9ers hard. However, this Seahawks team isn't as loaded as the
Raven's roster was. 9er's defense isn't top notch either, having given up 7 TDs to 4 ints and allowed an 89.9 rating to opposing
qbs. This divisional match up will be one for the times. Lets see how Metcalf, JSN, and Lockett face up against the 9ers d. This 
will also give Aiyuk, Kittle, and Jordan Mason more opportunties to torch their divisional rival. Seattle's ground attack will 
also be changined, as the 9er's have given up the least amount of rushing yards this seaon. Seahawks take it,
    31 to 24."
