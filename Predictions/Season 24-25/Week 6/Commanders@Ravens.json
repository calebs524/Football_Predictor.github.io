    "Comments": "This is probably the game of the week. Two high powered offensives led by mobile QBs is going to produce a lot of 
    thunder. Lamar Jackson and Jayden Daniels, both fast paced quarterbacks are facing off in this east coast showdown. The Ravens offense 
    under Todd Monken won't have any trouble with getting the balling moving, whether that's Lamar bombing it out to Likley or Flowers, or 
    him taking out on the run himself. However, this Commanders defense has done a pretty decent job in stopping the run, only allowing 1
    rushing touchdown. Looking at the other side, rookie sensation Jayden Daniels is coming out of the cage shooting. He 101 for 131, a 77.1%
    completion rate, and a 73.2 rating. His weapons in Terry McLaruin and Zach Ertz haven't let him down, and it's going to be a test against this 
    Ravens defense, who has allowed a 101 rating,
    9 TDs and 3 INTs. This is going to be a high powered offensive game, electric and fast. Ravens have 
    more expereince in Jackson and Harbaugh against Daniels and Quinn, and they are going to pick up the dub this week."
