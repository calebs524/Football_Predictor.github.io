    "Comments": "The Cardinals leave the desert to face off against the Packers, both who are coming off close wins. Jordan Love
    still looked sloppy against the Rams with that Pick Six, but is starting to put it back together. Kyler Murray on the other hand 
    showed why he's worth the first overall pick, as he was able to 'jet' his way into the endzone, hitting speeds above 20 MPH. 
    This is just more than just QB against QB though, head coaches Johnathan Gannan and Matt LaFleur are both experts in defense 
    and offense repsectively, and their scheming is going to be a real test. When it comes down to it, the Packers are just better on defense 
    and more capable of stopping Murray and MHJ. I think the Packers will be able to eek out 6 points at home."
