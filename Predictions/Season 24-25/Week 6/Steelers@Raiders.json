    "Comments": "As a bears fan, the most interesting story line for me is going to be how Fields performs against his old offensive
    coordinator in Luke Getsy. The steelers have been on a two game loosing streak, dropping close ones to the Colts and Cowboys. This 
    is going to be their chance to turn it around. Sure, the injuries on defense with Alex Highsmith and the offensive line is going to bite,
    but I got faith that Mike Tomlin and Arthur Smith will be able to right the ship. And the Raiders are in complete disarray over the Davante 
    Adams situation, and whoever starts under center next week is going to be running from TJ Watt. Even if the Steelers O line is decimated, Fields 
    is mobile enough in the pocket to escape the claws of Mad Maxx."
