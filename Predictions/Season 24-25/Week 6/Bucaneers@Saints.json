    "Comments": "This is going to be an interesting divisional match up. With Saint's qb Derek Carr out and back up Jake Haener
    in, the Saints are relying on their defense to make some big stops. This defense has allowed 1340 yards, but only 1 TD and 
    7 INTs, giving a 71.9 rating against qbs. They face Baker Mayfield, who is coming off a star performance against the Atlanta
    Falcons. The defense will mainly be up against Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. However, their run game with Rachaad White is 
    almost non existant. Looking to the other side, Tampa's DBs got torched aganist the Falcons offense. It wont be hard to stop 
    Jake Haener from lobbing it out to Rashid Shaheed and Taysom hill, so they will have to focus on Kamara now. However, the buc's 
    D line is able to create pressure, especially with nose tackle Vita Vea and outside linebacker Yaya Diaby. If the bucs want to win,
    they will have to rely on Liam Coen to be more aggressive in the second half, and make sure they cut out all the silly mistakes".
