    "Comments": "This game isn't to see if the Patriots get their sh*t togtether, it's to see who Drake Maye really is. Now personally,
    I don't like the idea of starting a rookie in week 6 if your plan was to bench him the whole year, but if it gives the offense the 
    spark they need, then it might be worth it. The problem with that is the Patriots O line is worse than a Mall cop security guard, and
    they are facing a dou of top pass rushers in Danille Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. Additionally, this Texans D is coming off a big win, as they
    held Josh Allen to under 9 completions. If the Patriots have any hope to win, they would have to feed Rhamondre Stevenson the ball like crazy.
    Sure, Nico Collins being out is going to limit CJ Stroud's passing gavme, but they still have Tank Dell, Diggs, Mixon who will be able to run up and 
    down the numbers in Gillette. This will be a good test to see what Maye can do with the ball, and how he puts things together under pressure."
