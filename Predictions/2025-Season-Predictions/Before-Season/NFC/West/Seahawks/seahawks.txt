Title: Rebuild in the Pacific Northwest

Image: IMG/SEA_Intro.jpg

Text: After just missing the playoffs in 2024 with a 10-7 record, the Seahawks zigged when everyone thought they would zag. Many sports analysts
and media outlets were suprised at the roster moves, such as moving off Geno Smith and DK Metcalf. ESPN analyst Mina Kimes ripped into this, and 
rightfully so: A team that barely missed the postseason due to strength of victory should be going all in, not rebuilding. The question shouldn't 
be why is this team rebuilding, but rather is this the best that this version of the Seattle Seahawks roster could have done? Did this core hit 
their ceiling?

Text: Every offseason, teams are forced to make cuts. Even the Eagles, with genius General Manager Howie Roseman were forced to move on from players 
part of their championship roster, and the Seahawks were no exception to this. Looking at the offensive core of Geno Smith, DK Metcalf, and Tyler Lockett,
not only was this trio older, but also costing a lot of cap dollars, which could be used for younger players. Looking at the numbers, moving on from 
the three saved the Seahawks almost $60 million against the cap. This is huge, especially when this roster has many other holes that needed to be filled.

Text: This offseason, the Seahawks took on a dead cap of $67,253,124, ranking 4th in the league. Teams that are taking on this dead cap are often considered 
to be rebuilding, as they are swapping older and pricier veterans for younger and cheaper talent. And the best way to make sure the team keeps performing well
with cheaper talent is through the draft. Trading away Geno Smith and DK Metcalf gave the Seahawks a 2nd, 3rd, and 7th round pick. This may not seem like a 
huge haul, but getting multiple day 2 picks for veterans looking for a new contract is a smart way to replenish a roster.

Text: The table above shows the roster cuts and trades the Seahawks made this past offseason. Looking at the older players, including the offensive trio 
mentioned above, Dre'Mont Jones, and Roy Robertson-Harris, it made sense for the Seahawks to move off these players. Sure, loosing older players means 
veteran experince and locker room leadership is lost, but that isn't the worst thing if you're saving cap dollars for cheaper and more effective players. 
While the Seahawks are carrying a lot of dead cap, they have saved $82,282,500 through trades and cuts, providing them with the flexibility to make various 
moves in free agency and the draft.

Text: Before I talk about the roster additions the Seahawks made this season, it's important to understand why the Seahawks went in this direction.
As I mentioned in the beginning, this was a 10 win roster that barely missed the post-season, so why reset now. The first reason is that this core had 
hit it's ceiling. Sure, the offensive trio of Geno Smith, Tyler Lockett, and DK Metcalf weren't the youngest players, but they also weren't the best 
available. 

Text: Now before I start to undermine the Seahawks offense, I have to say that this roster is talented. There's a reason why both Geno Smith and DK Metcalf 
are highly paid, and their performance in Seattle showed it. However, this isn't to say they should have been retained at all costs. Looking at Geno, his 
numbers had regressed since becomes the Seahawks starter in 2022. In particular, he had the most redzone interceptions among all starting QBs at 4 INTs, 
as well as the 3rd most interceptions in the league (15).  At the end of the day, Geno needed to be extended, and the front office didn't see him as a long term solution.
While I don't think Sam Darnold is going to take you to a superbowl, I do think the Seahawks did the right thing by parting ways with Geno.

Text: Speaking of this offense, the main kicker for the Seahawks was how lackluster their lackluster their execution was. Offensive Coordinator Ryan Grubb 
was not a terrible offensive coordinator by any means, but also not the Shanahan-McVay everyone wants. Many times, there was confusion on what was going on,
and many of the play calls were either predictable or not very creative. Grubb wasn't able to deploy Lockett well, and the offense stalled. They were 19th in offensive EPA per play,
20th in EPA per pass, and 19th in EPA per rush. These aren't bad metrics, but there is definetly areas for improvement here. Additionally, this team was 28th in league in rushing 
yards lash year (1,627 yards), but 12th in rushing TDs (17). Obviously, they had to compensate for Geno's redzone interceptions, but this rushing attack was just 
uninspiring. At the end of the day, Grubb’s and Macdonalds's philophies didn't align with the direction of the offense, and thus they parted ways.

Text: The worst part of the Seahawks offense was their offensive line. Along with injuries to Abraham Lucas, Anthony Bradford, and the retiring of Center Connor Williams
midway through the season, this unit just could not protect Geno. PFF gave them a 57.7 pass blocking grade. The front 5 had a 39.4% pressure rate (30th) and an 8.3% 
sack rate (24th). Now granted, a lot of offensive lines across the league struggled, whether it was depth or pass and run blocking. Regardless, it's important to always improve
your weaknesses, and the seahawks did just that this offseason.

Text: The first thing to do was to reset the offensive coaching staff. With Ryan Grubb out, MacDonald needed a playcaller on the same wave length, someone 
who could direct the offense to score points, run time off the clock, and not make costly turnovers. In comes Klint Kubiak, son of legend Gary Kubiak. Klint's 
last stint was a one year OC position with the New Orleans Saints, where he showcased his offensive prowess in the first two weeks by putting up back to back 
40 point games.

Text: Even when the season fell apart with injuries and Dennis Allen's firing, Kubiak was able to keep the offense afloat. The 2024 Saints were 15th in 
sack rate (6.02%) compared to the '24 Seahawks at 25th (8.04%). Additionally, the Saints were 18th in INT percentage (2.18%), 14th in rushing yards (1954 yards),
and 11th in EPA per rush. While these aren't insane offensive numbers, this is proof that Kubiak knows how to bring production to moving the ball up and down the 
field. His time with the 49ers as their QB coach in 2023 helped him understand the Shanahan system to the extent of mastering its timing, spacing, and run-pass balance.
With this knowledge, Kubiak brings a blueprint that could finally unlock consistency and rhythm that Mike MacDonald envsions.

Text: The biggest addition to the Seahawks this offseason was obviously Sam Darnold. Whatever you may think of him and his play over the years, last year was the first time 
we saw Darnold live up to the #3 overall hype. Although he had the perfect situation, he executed the offense almost flawlessly, throwing for over 4300 yards, 35 TDs, and 12 int.
Even though he fell off those last two games, winning 14 games his first season under Kevin O'Connell is an unreal stat. The contract the Seahawks got him at is also a steal. While 
he signed a 3 year $100 million contract, only the first year is fully guaranteed, giving the Seahawks a chance to back out if they need to. Additionally, Sam Darnold worked with 
Kubiak in 2023, when Darnold was backing up Brock Purdy on the 49er's Superbowl Run. Even though I think Geno Smith is a better QB, bringing in Darnold is the right move for moving 
into the next Seahawks era.

Text: In addition to adding a new signal caller, the Seahawks gave a promotion to their rising wideout one. There's a reason Jaxon Smith-Njigba was the 
first reciever off the board at 20 overall in 2023. His stats and measurables from Ohio state made QBs like Justin Fields and CJ Stroud shine, and it's 
about time to make him the WR 1 that he is. There will definetly be a hole that comes from trading DK Metcalf and cutting Tyler Lockett, but this front 
office was prepared to add new weapons. While Cooper Kupp isn't the same reciever he was during his triple crown season in 2021, he still provides Darnold a 
second solid recieving option. Additionally, Kubiak gets his guy in Marquez Valdes-Scantling, as MVS was his deep threat last year with the Saints. Moreover, 
TE Noah Fant and rookie TE Elijah Arroyo (50th overall) should provide Darnold with more options for pushing the ball down the field. It's JSN's time now to 
become the player everyone is waiting for him to be.

Text: Along with the recieving group, the Seahawks added much needed talent at Offensive Line. The most notable is their first round selection in North Dakota's 
Tackle Gray Zabel. Zabel, being the second OT off the board, is seen as a day one starter. He posted a 93.1 PFF pass-blocking grade in 2024, and allowed only 
three sacks in 864 pass-blocking snaps over the past two years. Zabel, being an athletic speciman at 6-6 and 312 lbs, is exactly the guy to stop tackles from 
pressuring Darnold. The Seahawks had other key additions of Josh Jobe to the OL, as well as picking up the fifth year option to Charles Cross. Cross was 
the 2022 9th overall pick, and had an 82.5 PFF grade in 2024, ranking 10th among tackles. Even though this Seahawks OL is far from perfect, these two young guys 
are promising for providing protection up front. 

Image: IMG/Elite_Defense.jpeg

Text: With all this talk about the offense, I haven't said much about this defense. That's because I don't have many critiques on it: It's Elite!
Mike MacDonald’s defense kicks ass, and although it took some time to get rolling, it's been an unstoppable force. This unit was 11th in EPA per play, 
9th in EPA per pass, 16th in EPA per rush, 11th in sack, and 16th in completion allowed. This is a fringe top 10 unit, and the key additions and retainments 
will only elevate what this defense will be next season. The main moves I will highlight is the resigning of ILB Ernest Jones, and drafting Nick Emmanwori
35th overall. The reason Mike MacDonald was hired was because his defense can shut down the Shanahan McVay offenses, making his playcalling and defensive 
schemes gold.

Text: It's a new day in Seattle. It may still be raining every day, but this Seahawks team is revitalized to take on next season. That being said, 
this isn't going to be an easy season for the Hawks. Seattle plays in a divison where every team is equally likely to win the divison. The lines have 
the Hawks as 8.5, and I am going to take the over on them. While Seattle has improved their roster, so has their opponents. With all that, I am predicting 
the Seahawks to win 11 games, and enter the playoffs as either between the 3rd and 6th seeds.
