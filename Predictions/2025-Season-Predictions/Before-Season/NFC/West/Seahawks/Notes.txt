Notable Draft additions:
Round, player, Overall pick, position, school, Reason to draft them
1	Grey Zabel	18	OT North Dakota St. Add OL Depth Much Needed 
2	Nick Emmanwori	35	SAF South Carolina, traded up w Titans using 52 and 82, (6-foot-4, 227 pounds), Kam Chancellor Build, strengthen secondary
2	Elijah Arroyo	50	TE Miami (FL), add weaponry and replenish TE room, complement Noah Fant
3	Jalen Milroe	92	QB Alabama, possible QB of the future???
7	Damien Martinez	223	RB Miami, RB Depth

Key Points:

Overall 2024 Season: 
    Very Shaky, 3-0 to 3-3- to 4-5 to 8-5 to 10-7
    Finished 8th in seeding, just missed wildcard
    With the 2024 roster, was this the peak this team could achieve?
    Points For: 375 (22.1/g) 18th of 32
    Points Against: 368 (21.6/g) 11th of 32, finge top 10 defense 
    First time HC in Mike MacDonald, replaces long time HC Pete Carrol
    tied with rams, lost divison in the last two weeks of the season

Defense:
    11th in EPA/play, 9th EPA/pass, 16th EPA/rush, 11th sack percentage, 16th in completion percentage
    Defense improved over the season 

OC Change:
    Grubb wasn't on same page as mcdonald
    Grubb couldn't get the run game going
    Lots of confusion with grubb 
    no creativity, not using Lockett
    Bad OL play 
    19th in offensive EPA/play, 20th EPA/pass, 19th EPA/rush, very middle of pack and predictable 


    "MacDonald wants to hold possession of the ball for a long time and run most of the time. It seemed like Grubb wanted to go with a much more air raid sort of “best shoe on turf” kind of offense. even our short game was mostly screens and stuff. I would imagine the two had so many conversations about this and then by week 18 we were still not really running the ball that much. So they decided to move on."
    Klint Kubiak Incoming: Most recent stint with Saints
     2024 saints: lots of injuries (including Carr)
        -0.05 EPA/play 22nd, 15h in Sack % 6.02% (may help with OL play), 18th in INT percentage (2.18%) compared to '24 hawks 2.70% (24th)
        can a new offesnive scheme, playcaller, qb, and weaponry spring the seahawks into action?
    3rd offensive system for JSN

Rushing:
    Seahawks 28th in league in rushing yards lash year (1,627 yards) but 12th in rushing TDs (17)
     Running it back with Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet, adding depth with Damient Martinez (7th round) 


Geno Smith Trade: 
    was a 3rd rounder (92nd overall) really all they could have gotten for Geno?
        look at what starting QBs were traded for in the past, as well as players traded for similar values (90-100th overall pick)
    Did Ryan Grubb as OC really get Geno angry enough to leave this team?
    Did this regime really want Geno, or were they trying to let him go?
    Did this team really not want to pay Geno as much?
    With Darnold in, how will this team fare?
    Did Geno hide up many of the IOL issues -> will Darnold be able to deal with IOL issues (look at Vikings last 2 games and issues with the IOL)
    Geno: Redzone Interceptions: Lead League with 5 Redzone INTs
    3rd most INTs (15) in the League
    With his stats declining, the seahawks decided to move off Geno

Sam Darnold Signing:
    Good price, not long term commitment
    What level of Sam Darnold will we get (weeks 1-17 or 18 and wildcard loss 2024)?
    Will Darnold hold up with a shaky OL
    How bad will things have to get to move to Milroe?

How much of an upgrade will Klint Kubiak be over Ryan Grubb:
    look at offensive playcalling, analyze Kubiak's first two weeks with the Saints and their powerhouse offensive production
    Running the ball, meshing well with shaky OL and Sam Darnold?
    
Change at Wide Reciever:
    JSN Is expected to be the guy now, can he fill the void that Lockett and Metcalf had left
    Will Kupp, MVS, and Noah Fant be good enough complementary pieces 
    Will kupp be healthy this season?? 


OL Changes:
    Please!! Don't let connor williams retire again
    Will Grey Zabel (18th overall) be good enough to shore up the IOL
    Will this Abraham Lucas and Anthony Bradford stay health this season 
    is there enough OL depth to sustain injuries
    Charles Cross extension?

Seahawks in offensive rebuild, going to push all in while tearing down old parts of the offense 
Did this offense hit it's ceiling in 2024?
How much of an upgrade will this recieving core be?


Overall Team build:    
    Revitalized offense, team is going in new direction
    taking on $67,253,124 (4th) in Dead Cap, Possible rebuild?
    How long is john schneider and Mike MacDonald's leash?

2025 Outlook:
    How will this team fare in the NFC west?
    Will Rams (with verse, fiske, and turner) spook Darnold 2x a year?
    Have them going 9-8, 3-3 in the divison
    This team is definetly improved, but will face tough competition this year
