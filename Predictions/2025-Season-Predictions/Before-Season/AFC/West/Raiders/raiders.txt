Title: New Gambles in Sin City

Image: IMG/CaSpSm.jpeg

Text: It's no secret the Raiders are trying to clean up the mistakes of the past. After 3 consecutive loosing seasons, the franchise is going with 
proven success in Head Coach Pete Carroll and Quarterback Geno Smith, along with a rising front office star in general manager John Spytek. 
After Tom Brady became a minority owner of the Raiders in October 2024, he vowed to bring success and a winning culture to Las Vegas. Along with changes at 
head coach and general manager, the raiders have made important roster changes this offseason, but will it be enough to make them competitive in an already 
cut throat AFC West?

Text: Last year, the raiders were bad at almost everything. They averaged 18.2 points per game (29th), allowed 25.5 to opponents on 
average (25th), and was at the bottom of the league for average rushing yards per game at 79.8. Suprisingly, they had the 9th best 
passing yards per game at 242.2. With all of these flaws, there's a big question for how this was even allowed to happen.

Text: Looking back at the 2024 off season, the Raiders were riding on "vibes". With a mid-season firing of Josh McDaniels, the Raiders
went 5-4 under interim head coach Antonio Pierce (originally the Linebackers coach), including a Christmas day win against the Cheifs in 
Arrowhead Stadium, and a 63-21 beating against the Chargers (which ultimately got Brandon Staley and Tom Telesco fired). After that brief
stint, however, the Raiders soon dropped back to Earth.

Text: In the 2024 off season, the Raiders were set to keep Pierce as their head coach. They didn't even interview many other candidates,
as Pierce was named the teams head coach right in Janurary after the season finished. However, the coaching search didn't get easier from 
there. The team was able to retain Patrick Graham as their defensive coordinator, and brought in Tom Telesco as their General Manager, who
was the Chargers GM until the 63-21 loss. Kliff Kingsbury was in contract negotiations for their Offensive Coordinator position, but backed 
out due to contract disputs, as well as not wanting to coach for a team with a wonky quarterback situation. They ended up with Luke Getsy, 
who was fired from the Bears (for good reason).

Text: That Raiders 2024 season was a disaster. Not only was the team loosing hard, but the locker room and vibes that Pierce had brought were
falling apart. Davante Adams, the Raiders Wide Reciever, had basically forced a trade to New York after he realized the Raiders had no potential.
Many players reported a lack of organization, time management, and accountability by the coaching staff. The lone brightspots on this team were
rookie tight end Brock Bowers and Defensive End Maxx Crosby.

Text: Yes, the Raiders had a bad 2024 season, but that doesn't mean 2025 will follow suit. Vegas has them at 7.5 wins, and the changes they made 
seem promising.

Text: The first major change owners Tom Brady and Mark Davis made were to fix up the power structure. In Janurary 2025, the Raiders wasted no time,
bringing in Superbowl winning head coach Pete Carroll and Tampa Bay executive John Spytek. Spytek had worked with general manager Jason Licht, who both 
built up the 2020 Buccaneers roster that Tom Brady was on to win the superbowl. Additionally, they brought in former Ohio State offensive coordinator Chip
Kelly to run the offense, while retaining Patrick Graham as defensive coordinator. With a renewed power structure, the Raiders could get to work.

Text: This Raiders team wasn't completely barren, as it has some offensive cornernstones in TE Brock Bowers, G Jackson Powers-Johnson, WR Jakobi Meyers, and TE Michael Mayer.
 Using these, Spytek was able to reunite Carroll with his former quaterback in Geno Smith, who had led the Seahawks to 3 
 consecutive winning seasons, with 2 under Carroll. The Raiders traded a 3rd round pick for Smith, and gave him a 2 year, $75 million extension. 
Additionally, they brought in No. 6 overall pick RB Ashton Jeanty and WR Jack Bech to round out the offense. This may not be a high powered offense, but there is definetly 
more potential now.

Text: On the defensive side, the Raiders have been able to put some pieces together. They already had a top star DE in Maxx Crosby, who got a  
contract extension of $35.5 APY, which breifly made him the top paid non-QB. Additionally, they were able to retain DE Malcolm Koonce, and brought in 
S Jermey Chinn, CB Eric Stokes, and LB Germaine Pratt. While this defensive secondary isn't truly elite, it has a dimension of depth that the Raiders 
have been lacking for a bit. Additionally, the are expecting Christian Wilkins to be back healthy, who had signed a pricy $110 million contract last offseason.

Text: This new roster and personnel has brought a sense of competition and toughness to a Raiders team that won 4 games last year. While this roster has 
been improved and the coach is looking to win now, this Raiders team is still in a division with a perennial superbowl contender in the Cheiefs, as well as
both the Chargers and Broncos who made wild card appearances last season. For this upcoming season, the lines has vegas around 7.5 wins. I am taking the 
over, with the Raiders winning 9 games. While I don't believe this team is going to beat the Chiefs or the Eagles, this new Raiders team is going to take 
out the bad losses, the ugly mistakes, and will be able to win close games. This revitalized offense should be able to put up points, and the defense should 
be able to make key stops and turnovers, even if they don't have a loaded secondary.
