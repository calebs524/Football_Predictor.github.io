Text: It's no secret the Raiders are trying to clean up the mistakes of the past. After 3 consecutive loosing seasons, the franchise is going with 
proven success in Head Coach Pete Carroll and Quarterback Geno Smith, along with a rising front office star in general manager John Spytek. 
After Tom Brady became a minority owner of the Raiders in October 2024, he vowed to bring success and a winning culture to Las Vegas. Along with changes at 
head coach and general manager, the raiders have made important roster changes this offseason, but will it be enough to make them competitive in an already 
cut throat AFC West?
