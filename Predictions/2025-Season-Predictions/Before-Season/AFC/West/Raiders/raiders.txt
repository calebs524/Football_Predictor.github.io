Title: Brady, Carroll, and Spytek Gambling the Future in Sin City

Text: It's no secret the Raiders are trying to clean up the mistakes of the past. After 3 consecutive loosing seasons, the franchise is going with 
proven success in Head Coach Pete Carroll and Quarterback Geno Smith, along with a rising front office star in general manager John Spytek. 
After Tom Brady became a minority owner of the Raiders in October 2024, he vowed to bring success and a winning culture to Las Vegas. Along with changes at 
head coach and general manager, the raiders have made important roster changes this offseason, but will it be enough to make them competitive in an already 
cut throat AFC West?

Text: Last year, the raiders were bad at almost everything. They averaged 18.2 points per game (29th), allowed 25.5 to opponents on 
average (25th), and was at the bottom of the league for average rushing yards per game at 79.8. Suprisingly, they had the 9th best 
passing yards per game at 242.2. With all of these flaws, there's a big question for how this was even allowed to happen.

Text: Looking back at the 2024 off season, the Raiders were riding on "vibes". With a mid-season firing of Josh McDaniels, the Raiders
went 5-4 under interim head coach Antonio Pierce (originally the Linebackers coach), including a Christmas day win against the Cheifs in 
Arrowhead Stadium, and a 63-21 beating against the Chargers (which ultimately got Brandon Staley and Tom Telesco fired). After that brief
stint, however, the Raiders soon dropped back to Earth.

Text: In the 2024 off season, the Raiders were set to keep Pierce as their head coach. They didn't even interview many other candidates,
as Pierce was named the teams head coach right in Janurary after the season finished. However, the coaching search didn't get easier from 
there. The team was able to retain Patrick Graham as their defensive coordinator, and brought in Tom Telesco as their General Manager, who
was the Chargers GM until the 63-21 loss. Kliff Kingsbury was in contract negotiations for their Offensive Coordinator position, but backed 
out due to contract disputs, as well as not wanting to coach for a team with a wonky quarterback situation. They ended up with Luke Getsy, 
who was fired from the Bears (for good reason).

Text: That Raiders 2024 season was a disaster. Not only was the team loosing hard, but the locker room and vibes that Pierce had brought were
falling apart. Davante Adams, the Raiders Wide Reciever, had basically forced a trade to New York after he realized the Raiders had no potential.
Many players reported a lack of organization, time management, and accountability by the coaching staff. The lone brightspots on this team were
rookie tight end Brock Bowers and Defensive End Maxx Crosby.
