Title: Will the Horseshoe be lucky this season?

Text: Before I dive into the season outlook for the Colts, I want to offer my condolences for the late Jim Irsay. His impact on the 
franchise, the league, and the Indianapolis community was profound. Under his leadership, the Colts experienced both incredible highs 
and enduring loyalty from fans. His legacy will undoubtedly be felt for generations, and this upcoming season carries a weight of 
remembrance and gratitude for all he gave to the organization.

Text: 2 years ago, the NFL landscape was much different: The Jets were expected to win a superbowl with Rodgers, Geno Smith started the 
vetran revival, and the Colts organization was climbing up from rock bottom. After a disastrous 2022 season, where the Colts went 4-12-1,
change was inevitable. Those past 4 seasons, the Colts had a revolving door of bridge quarterbacks, where Frank Reich and Chris Ballard were 
able to piece together season after season, either making a wild card appearance or just missing the playoffs.
There was no way that magic was going to last forever, and the combination of an aging Matt Ryan, injuries, and a midseason firing was enough to 
break the cycle of bridge quaterbacks bringing mediocrity to Indianapolis.

Text: The downfall of 2022 gave the Colts an opportunity to start new, and let Chris Ballard keep his job. Shane Steichen had been the offensive
coordinator with the Eagles, where he oversaw the development of Jalen Hurts in 2021 and 2022, where he helped Hurts develop into a top 10 
quarterback. Steichen was also the architect of the 2020 Chargers offense, where Justin Herbert became the Offensive Rookie of the Year.
In the 2022 season, Steichen's offense was 3rd in the league for points scored (averaging 28.1 points per game), 2nd in the league for 
rushing yards and rushing touchdowns (3,048 yards and 29 touchdowns), and helped bring the Eagles toe to toe with the Cheifs for the superbowl.
In anyone knew how to develop a quaterback and run an offense successfully, it was him. 

Text: Additionally, the Colts NEEDED a new signal caller. After having hired Steichen, owner Jim Irsay had declared the Colts needed to draft a quaterback,
which was very understandable. The 2023 draft class had 3 top quaterbacks, with Bryce Young and CJ Stroud expected to go in the top 2 picks. Many teams, 
included the Colts, had tried to trade up with Chicago for the coveted number one pick, but the Panthers had won out in the end. This left the Colts at 
pick 4, eyeing to take Anthony Richardson. 

Text: Now at the time, Richardson was seen as a project quaterback. Teams knew he only started for one season in college, and needed time to develop. 
The reason why Richardson was valued so highly was his athletic traits. The combine stats as well as his tape showed him to be someone who could 
revolutionize the game, and seemed to become the next Josh Allen. Pairing an athletic freak of nature and a QB guru seemed like a 
match made in heaven, so why does the floor seem to be falling out now?

Text: The short answer: He hasn't had enough time on the field. Richardson's rookie season was cut short due to a season-ending AC joint sprain in his throwing shoulder, 
requiring surgery. That season, Gardner Minshew, who had previous expereince with Steichen in Philly, was under center to lead the Colts to a 9-8 season. During
this time, Minshew wasn't spectacular, throwing for 15 touchdowns, 9 interceptions, and 3300 yards, but also wasn't bad. This season didn't only highlight Minshew's 
starting abilities, but also the fact that a Colts team lead by a backup quaterback was within one play of making the playoffs, and that a real quaterback could 
revolutionize this team. 

Text: In the 2024 season, expectations were high for Anthony Richardson. Not only was he coming back healthy, but the team around him was much more versatile. Richardson
was going to play behind one of the top offensive lines, and have an arsenal of weapons including Josh Downs, Adonai Mitchell, Alec Pierce, Michael Pittman Jr, and Johnathan Taylor. 
Alas, injuries to Richardson, as well as inconsistent play and consistently missing open targets caused the 2024 campaign to fall apart. Richardson had 47.4% completion, threw for 
8 TDs to 12 INTs, and was benched for Joe Flacco for taking himself out of a game due to "feeling tired". All the concerns about Richardson's lack of expereince, injury history, and 
character issues were starting to come back to him.

Text: Along with the passing concerns, many of the Colts issues also pointed to the defense. The colts ranked
13th in EPA/play on defense (-0.01), while being 26th in EPA against the pass (0.08), but a stellar 6th in EPA against the run (-0.09).
While they had a strong run defense, their passing defense was pathetic. They allowed 243.6 passing yards on average (26th), 27 passing 
TDs (22nd), and had an EPA of 0.51 for yards after the catch (27th). Throughout the season, many fans and media outlets were calling for
former defensive coordinator Gus Bradley's job, as the Colts defense was too talented to be this bad. His worst performance came on a  
week 17 loss, where the 2-14 Giants put up 45 points against the Colts with backup quarter Drew Lock. 
This loss elimated the Colts from playoff contention, and sealed Bradley's fate, as he was fired shortly after the regular season. 

Text: While fixing the defense wouldn't solve all their problems it would definetly patch up major holes. The first thing to do was find 
the right captain to lead this unit. Lou Anarumo, former defensive coordinator from the Bengals, was also fired this off-season. While 
his defense wasn't as elite as it in previous years, and was one of the bigger reasons for the Bengals not making the playoffs in 2024, 
I don't believe Anarumo is completely at fault. I won't go on a tangent, but there has been an issue with the Bengals not retaining key 
defensive players, including pro bowl saftey Jessie Bates III and DT DJ Reader. With that said, Lou definetly made some questionable calls 
in 2024, and gets a chance to redeem himself with a new team and roster. 



Text: While Richardson may not have become the elite qb everyone was expecting, the Colts season wasn't all doom and gloom. 
The 2024 preseason odds had the Colts at 8.5 wins, and they finished just slightly under. This team, while not having a solid passer,
 averaged 22.2 points per game (17th) and allowed 25.1 points per game on average on defense (24th). These aren't elite numbers, but they
  aren't awful either, and the team was able to fix up some of the holes this off season.
