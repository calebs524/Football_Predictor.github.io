Title: Are the Browns really as bad as people say they are?

Text: If you go back a year, there was a different aura around the Cleveland Browns. They were coming off a 2023 season where they 
went 11-6, made a wild card appearance, and had arguably the best defense in the leauge. They had a coach of the year in Kevin Stefanski,
Defensive Player of the year in Myles Garrett, Comeback player of the year in Joe Flacco, and Assistant Coach of the year in defensive coordinator
Jim Schwartz. Even though they had 5 starting qbs that season, they were the 5 seed in the league, and had a versatile defense consisting of 
Garret, Martin Emerson, Jerimiah Owusu-Koramoah, and other rising defensive stars. They split 3-3 with divisional opponents, and went 4-1 in 
their last 5 games. Considering they were the 10th best scoring offense and 13th best scoring defense a year ago, how did the Browns get to 
where they are now?

Text: I'm not going to even talk about Deshuan Watson's off the field issues, but I do want to look at his on the field stats. Deshaun was 5-1 in 
2023, posting 1115 yards, 7 TD and 4 INT. He was injured on and off as his time starting, and was done for the season after a season ending shoulder 
injury week 10 against the Ravens. When he came back in 2024, he was not the same. He was 1-6 until an achilles tear against the Bengals in week 7,
and had thrown for 1148 yards, 5 TD and 3 INT. The team was in ruins, and he was just an awful quaterback. Even taking out the civil cases, Deshuan was 
not even 25% of his former Houston self. He didn't throw for over 200 passing yards in any of the 2024 games he played, and had taken 33 sacks in those 7 
games. Even when he was over, the Browns weren't much better, as starting Jameis Winston, Dorian Thompson-Robinson, and Biley Zappee got 2 wins, 8 losses, 
14 TD, and 20 INT (12 from Jameis alone). This Browns offense was just putrid, and needed to be cleaned up.

Text: Looking at the Browns 2024, defense, they weren't as much of a trainwreck as the offense was. The unit ranked 14th in the league for EPA per play, and 
10th in the leauge for EPA against the rush. While the secondary was banged up (JOK and Denzel Ward), this team was 21st in rushing 
yards allowed, and 11th in passing yards allowed. In 2023, this defense was elite, as it allowed the 2nd least passing yards, 
11th least rushing yards, and ranked top of the leauge in EPA per play. While the defense did decline in 2024, it can still pick 
up the pieces in 2025, especially with the continuity of Jim Schwartz and Myles Garrett.

Text: The Browns roster was constructed to be in a winning mode, especially since the trade of Deshaun Watson. In 2020, General Manager Andrew Berry and 
Head Coach Kevin Stefanski were hired to rebuild the dog pound. However, this wasn't a roster that needed to be rebuilt. In that 2020 season, the Browns went 
11-5, suprising the league and making a wild card appearance, where they handedly beat the Steelers 48 to 37. In the divisional round, the Browns had a close 
loss to the Chiefs, 17-22. This roster and regime was in a win now window, and was supposed to be competing for a championship.

Text: After that 2020 season, the team realized they were all in, had made moves to ensure they would get closer to a championship. This included extending 
cornerstone players (such as G Wyatt Teller), bringing in free agent talent (including S John Johnson III and Troy Hill), and drafting key 
cornerstones, such as Greg Newsome II and JOK. While they made all in moves for the 2021 season, they Browns didn't get far, as they ended up going 8-9. This was 
because of an injury QB Baker Mayfield sustained week 2 against Houston, and deteriorated his play. In 2021, Baker threw for 3010 yards, 17 TD and 13 INT, and 
was reported to have attitude issues around the building. At the end of that season, GM Andrew Berry and HC Kevin Stefanski had a decision to make.

Text: The thing about NFL HC and GMs is that they want to win. Very rarely do teams actually try to tank for the #1 overall pick, as that could lead to GMs and HCs 
being fired, even if the team does get that "generation talent". In the Browns case, Andrew Berry and Kevin Stefanski didn't want to have Baker on the roster. As they 
had seen in 2020, this was a top 10 roster (if not top 5), and was easily capable of making a deep playoff run. HC Kevin Stefanski didn't want Baker Mayfield holding the team back 
from a potential superbowl, and didn't want his job tied to a QB with attitude and skill issues. This roster wasn't getting any younger, so it was time for them to make a swing to get the QB they wanted.

Text: In the NFL, it's rare for a starting QB to become available, let alone a QB with 3 consecutive probowl seasons and a stunning resume. For Deshuan Watson to be available, 
it meant that any team that desperately needed a starting qb was giving up the sun and moons to get Deshuan. While the Watson trade looks bad now, back in 2022, there were many 
teams willing to give up 3 first round picks and change to get him, including the Saints and Panthers. Many teams were willing to give up the draft captial, but not to give Deshaun 
the $243 million guaranteed that he was asking for, outside of the Browns. Berry and Stefanski were desperate to win now, and didn't want to deal with another Baker Mayfield situation.

Text: Fastforwarding to now, this Browns team is a completely different story than two years ago. Instead of being the perennial AFC championship team with an elite dual threat
quaterback and a stacked roster that Andrew Berry had envisioned, it's now a depleted roster with little to no cash, barely any youth, and a quaterback room which looks more like a 
roulette wheel with all the options. Outside of the Deshaun Watson move, Berry's goal was to make this Browns roster a championship roster from 2022 to 2025. Many of the teams cornerstones 
were extended such that their contracts would expire after the 2025 or 2026 off-season. This roster was

, as many of the this roster's 
cornerstones are getting older and on expiring contracts. 







With the Myles Garret extension and the Deshuan Watson contract, there wasn't much the Browns could do in free agency.
