Title: What's hotter, South Beach or McDaniel's Seat?

Text: Even after the Smith-Ramsey-Fitzpatrick trade, are the Dolphins really a team to be reckoned with?
This team has had a rollercoaster these last 3 seasons with McDaniels calling the shots, and I don't think this season is going up.

Text: Now I do have to acknowledge this Dolphins team isn't in the worst situation in leauge. With a healthy Tua last year, they went 6-5, 
which isn't too bad. However, Tua isn't always healthy, and that's the real biter with this roster. This team also needs depth at a lot of 
positions, and we will be taking a look at where they are. 

Text: The past 3 seasons with McDaniels, the fins went 9-8, 11-6, and 8-9, with a playoff appearance those first two seasons. In 2023, they 
scored 496 points (2nd most in the league), and ranked first in both total offensive yards (6822) and passing yards (4514). With all this 
offensive success, why is there so much confusion surrounding them?

Text: With a concussion in week 2 of the 2024 season, the Dolphins went from an offesnive powerhouse to a trainwreck of a team. The backup 
quarterbacks had no clue what they were doing, and the Defense, which wasn't super impressive to begin with, wasn't able to carry the team.
They went 2-4 without Tua, and many of the teams weaknesses (including a lack of trench and defensive secondary depth) became apparent.

Text: To add to this 2024 mess, the Dolphins didn't make too many big moves this off season. Excluding the Ramsey-Fitzpatrick trade, the 
Dolphins picked up QB Zach Wilson, WR Nick Westbrook Ikhine, and OG James Daniels on a 3 Year $24 Million contract. The dolphins really 
didn't have much cap space to work with, as they extended Tua Tagovailoa, WR Tyreek Hill, CB Jalen Ramsey, and WR Jalen Waddle all last 
season. The 4 have a combined cap hit of $88 million, roughly 28% of the salary cap (This takes into account Ramsey's dead cap). Thats a 
ridiculous investment in a banged up QB with injury concerns, a WR who has questionable priorities, and a CB who isnt' on the roster anymore.

Text: Now, there really isn't one single person to throw the blame on for this. Chris Grier has had this roster for 9 seasons now, and 
hasn't constructed a roster that's won a playoff game. McDaniel's, for as genius of an offensive playcaller as he is, has trouble controlling 
the locker room. Additionally, the defensive coorindator role has been a revolving door under McDaniels, with the likes of Josh Boyer, Vic 
Fangio (who just won a Superbowl with the Eagles), and Anthony Weaver. I won't get too much into Ramsey's and Mostert's comments on how the 
players are treated by the coaching staff, but I will say these types of media reveals are telling for a teams cutlure.

Text: If you think this whole article is going to be me downing on the Dolphins 2025 season, you might want to think again. As big of a hole 
as they are in, they have some key pieces who are coming back. 2 Time pro bowler Bradley Chubb, who tore his ACL in December of 2023, is 
expected to return healthy in September. Additionally, Jaelan Phillips, who tore his ACL in November of 2023, has a chance to come back for 
the 2025 season. RT Austin Jackson, who had a knee surgery in November 2024, is expected to be back from training camp. 

Text: While it's good to see injured players come back to the team, the question is how will this roster be? With any injury, it takes time 
for a player to come back and get to a solid playing level, especially with soft tissue and knee tears. However, these injured players coming 
back will add depth for this Dolphins roster. 

Text: Now, if you’re waiting for a prediction on how all of this plays out—spoiler alert—it’s not a full-on collapse, but it’s not a 
deep playoff run either. The Dolphins aren’t going to totally tank. Tua’s health remains a giant question mark, but if he stays on the field, 
this team has enough offensive talent to stay afloat. The defense gets a bit of a boost with Minkah Fitzpatrick and returning players like 
Chubb and Phillips, but don’t expect miracles.

Text: Another major uncertainty lies with the offensive line. With the retirement of Terron Armstead, a five-time Pro Bowl left tackle 
and the team’s best pass protector, the Dolphins lose not just talent, but leadership and experience. In his place, Miami is hoping for 
rapid development from young players—including second-round rookie Jonah Savaiinaea, who is expected to step into the left guard role.
While Savaiinaea has a high ceiling, asking a 2nd round rookie to immediately solidify a line that already struggled with consistency 
is a big ask. The rest of the unit remains a patchwork mix of returning veterans and unproven depth, which doesn’t inspire much 
confidence—especially for a quarterback like Tua who thrives when protected but has a history of injuries when he’s not.

Text: Still, when you look at the schedule, it's hard to see this team breaking out beyond what we've already seen. They’ll be competitive 
against mid-tier teams, but when it comes to playoff-caliber squads—like the Bills, Ravens, and even the Chargers—I don’t see the Dolphins 
pulling off signature wins. Realistically, they’re staring down another 8 to 9 win season, just like last year. The lines have Miami at 7.5 wins,
and I think that getting to 8 or 9 wins is realistic, but getting over the hump for getting in and winning a playoff game seems a bit out of reach.

Text: And here's the kicker: the division is no longer a two-team race. The Jets are healthier and more balanced, and the Patriots, while still 
rebuilding, have made enough improvements to become a legitimate headache twice a year. The AFC East is tightening up, and Miami isn’t pulling
away—they're getting reeled in.
