    "Comments": "There's a lot of significance with this game: trick plays, NFC standings, ect. Dallas's roster face's lots of 
    injuries: Parsons, the O line, and the secondary. Brandon Cooks looks cooked, and Dak is barely able to squeeze out a win against 
    the Lions. Flip the page, and this Lions team is on fire. They come off a bye from having decimated the before undefeated Seahwaks,
    where Goff looked like a super star and the offense was clicking. Campbell shouldn't attempt any trick plays this time around, and just
    play rip you knee caps out football. Mike Zimmer faces his old rival from Detroit, and will struggle to contain any plays from Ben Johnson."
