    "Comments": "The colts take a trip to the music city this week as they face their divisional rival, the Tennesse Titans.
    The colts come off a gut wrenching loss to the Jags, who kicked in a last second field goal, while the titans come off their bye.
    Both of these teams have second years qbs who both faced injuries, and are looking to get back on track. The titans have a solid defense,
    with D end Sebastian Joseph-Day and corner back L'Jarious Sneed. They face a Colts offense who is known to bomb it down the field. AR is a 
    magaican in lobbing the ball up to his deep threat in Alec Pierce, and it wouldn't take him too long to score a TD. Looking on the other side,
    Will Levis has under performed with what was given. Ridley, Pollard, and Hopkins haven't seen as many targets as they would have liked. Luckily for 
    them, Gus Bradley and the Colt's defense has been a disaster, so they have a chance in being able to throw some points on the board. In the end tough, 
    I don't think Will Levis will be enough to help the Titans win, and the Colts will be able to sneak another one in to come back to 3-3.","Post Game Analysis": "Joe Does it again, he does some magic and gets his team the dub"
