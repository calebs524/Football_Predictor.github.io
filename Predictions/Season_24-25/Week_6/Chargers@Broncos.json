    "Comments": "This isn't a match up of Herbert and Nix... no, this is Jim Harbaugh against Sean Payton. Two premiere head coaches
    who are facing off for second place in their divison. Herbert and the bolts come off a bye while Nix and co. are riding in hot, coming off a 
    big victory against the Raiders. There's a lot of optimism for both teams: The chargers are finding ways to spread the ball, the Broncos are 
    able to hold their oponents offense, and both of them are finding new ways to win. This is going to be a close game, with both teams scoring fast.
    It's going to come down to the wire and a couple plays. Harbaugh and Herbert have more expereince than Nix and Payton, and they'll be able to squeeze 
    out a victory and get to second in the divison.","Post Game Analysis": "Now this one is interesting, the Chargers held their own for most part, even with the Broncos making a big push there at the end."
