    "Comments": "I'm not gonna add speculation about why Woody canned Saleh this early, but I will say this: you aren't the 2021 Raiders
    who made it to the playoffs after firing Jon Gruden. Rodgers is basically running the offense and hasn't done a very good job of it. Sure, 
    he has been able to make some plays, but if Garret Wilson and Mike Williams aren't performing, what's gotta change? The Bills on the other 
    hand have a really good shot of changing their narrative. If they are able to figure out their kinks and issues this week, Allen can finally 
    take control of the offense. They go up against one of the top defensive play callers in the leauge, and they have lost to the Jets in the big 
    Apple the last two years, so there's a chance history repeats itself. If McDermott can steady the ship and hold the Rodgers circus, they have a 
    chance to take the dub."
