    "Comments": "This international game across the pond features 2 teams who both come off pretty good wins. Chicago decks the
Carolina Panthers (the ones who basically restocked their roster with draft picks), while the jags sneak out their first 
dub of the season against their divisional rival. This game features two first over all picks in rookie Sensation Caleb Williams
and "Possible Franchise Quarterback" Trevor Lawrence. The Jag's offense is starting to come together, with rushers Tank Bigsby
and Travis Etienne, who face a bears defense who has allowed 4.8 yards per carry. Trevors game is starting to come together,
as he threw for 371 yards,
    2 tds, and 1 int for a 119.5 rating. However, the Bears secondary is on of the best,
holding opposing QBs to 2 TDs and 6 Ints. Of course, with Jaquan Brisker being questionable, there is more possible wiggle
room for Trevor to bomb it out to BTJ. Looking on the other side, the Bears offense is starting to show more consistency.
Williams is able to go through this reads properly and get the ball out in time. His recieving trio in Keenan Allen, Rome Odunze,
and DJ Moore with the support of Cole Kmet and Deandre Swift make this easy. The main point of contention will be the offensive
line, who has allowed 17 sacks, the most in the league. They can't afford to fall apart like string cheese against Josh Allen Hines,
Jacksonville's star Defensive pride. The Jaguars defense hasn't been good outside of him, allowing over 1500 passing yards for
10 TDs and no INTs. This match up will be the Jag's first loss at their second home, and they might leave Pederson in London if
they can't beat Flus.","Post Game Analysis": "As a bears fan, I couldn't be happier about our win on the other side of the pond. The offense is finally starting to click 
and the defense is showing why they are the real deal. As for Jacksonville, the only culture change needed is to boot out the entire coaching staff"
