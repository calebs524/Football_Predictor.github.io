    "Comments": "If you told me before the season that Danny Dimes and the Giants are going to beat the Bengals, I would have 
    laughed at you. The truth is, Cincinatti's offense is the only reason why they were in the Baltimore game last week. Lou Anarumo 
    has lost his defensive magic, and Zac Taylor is squandering away the talent of this team. Nabers might be out, but that doesn't mean 
    Danny can't spread the wealth. Devin Singletary, Tyrone Tracy, Eric Gray, and Wan'Dale Robinson are able to fill in until Nabers is back 
    in action, and this Giant's defense looks better each week. I wouldn't be suprised if they return another botched FG for a tuddy.","Post Game Analysis": "To think that Lou Anarumo could hold Daboll to only 7 points is a suprise, but yet again they do have Daniel Jones."
